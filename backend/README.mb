# ALOHA Node Manager (Backend)

The ALOHA Node Manager is the central backend module responsible for coordinating ROS 2 service operations, managing camera feeds, and executing predefined robot control workflows through external processes. It acts as the interface between frontend inputs and low-level robotic bringup and control.

## System Overview

This module exposes three core services to frontend interfaces (web or Raspberry Pi GUI):

- **launch_ros2**: Launches the ALOHA bringup stack.
- **run_sleep**: Executes a predefined sleep mode behavior.
- **run_auto_record**: Triggers automated task recording based on user input.

These services ensure coordinated execution and prevent overlap by terminating running subprocesses before new actions are initiated.
